# MF_Automated_Pipeline
An automated pipeline for analyzing large numbers of merFISH samples with minimal human hours.

#### Purpose
This pipeline was made in order to both improve on the cell segmentation step of the Vizgen MERSCOPE pipeline, as well as automate quality control and first visualizations of the data.

## Info

#### merbot
Is the actuall command line script. Most of the actual code is in the cli folder

#### _trashbin
This one is for files that I made pre-2024.10.25 that I do not think will be useful, but cant bring to delete. Most of them are from when I was trying to dynamically generate snakemake files. May be useful later, so I'll keep them around.
